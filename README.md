# Beyond The Zero: A Data-Driven Protocol for Identifying Growth Leaders
## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the financial stability of companies that pay 0% tax. While this group is 12x more likely to face bankruptcy , it represents nearly 38% of the total market. We developed a protocol to help financial institutions identify "Growth Leaders" while avoiding high-risk failures.

## 📊 The Dataset
We utilized the Taiwanese Bankruptcy dataset consisting of 6,819 firms. It includes a wide range of financial indicators such as Debt Ratio, Total Asset Growth, and Net Income to differentiate between healthy and bankrupt entities.
